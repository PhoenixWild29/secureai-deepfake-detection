### **Objection Handling**

#### **"It's too expensive"**
```
Response:
"I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at the cost of NOT having deepfake 
protection. The average deepfake incident costs $250,000. SecureAI at $19,990/year 
pays for itself by preventing just one incident. Most customers see ROI within 
the first month.

Let me show you a quick ROI calculation based on your specific situation..."

[Use ROI Calculator]

"As you can see, you'd save approximately $[X] in the first year alone. Can we 
discuss how to fit this into your security budget?"
```

#### **"We're not experiencing deepfake issues"**
```
Response:
"That's actually the best time to implement protection - before you have an 
incident. Deepfake technology is advancing rapidly, and attacks are increasing 
300% year-over-year. 

It's like cybersecurity insurance - you hope you never need it, but when a 
deepfake attack happens, the damage is done. Our customers tell us they sleep 
better knowing they're protected.

What would be the cost to your organization if an executive impersonation video 
went viral or was used to authorize a fraudulent wire transfer?"
```

#### **"We'll build it internally"**
```
Response:
"I appreciate you have strong technical capabilities. Let me share what we've 
learned: Building a production-ready deepfake detection system requires:

‚Ä¢ 6-12 months of development time
‚Ä¢ Team of 3-5 AI/ML engineers ($150K+ each)
‚Ä¢ Specialized expertise in deepfake techniques
‚Ä¢ Continuous model training and updates
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure and operational costs
‚Ä¢ Compliance and security certifications

Most organizations estimate $500K-$1M to build and $200K+ annually to maintain.

SecureAI gives you all of this for $19,990/year with immediate deployment, 
ongoing improvements, and compliance built-in. Plus, your team can focus on 
your core business instead of building deepfake detection.

Would it make sense to start with SecureAI while you evaluate the build vs. 
buy decision?"
```

#### **"We need to see it work first"**
```
Response:
"Absolutely! Seeing is believing with SecureAI. I can set you up with:

Option 1: Live Demo (30 minutes)
  - I'll analyze your sample videos live
  - Show real-time results
  - Answer all your questions

Option 2: 14-Day Free Trial
  - Full Professional tier access
  - 100 analyses included
  - No credit card required
  - Dedicated support

Option 3: Pilot Program (30 days)
  - Production environment
  - Full integration setup
  - Dedicated solutions architect
  - Custom ROI analysis

Which option works best for your evaluation process?"
