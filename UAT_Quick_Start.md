# UAT Quick Start Guide
## SecureAI DeepFake Detection System

### ðŸš€ Getting Started with UAT

The UAT environment has been set up and is ready for testing! Here's how to get started quickly.

---

## âœ… What's Already Set Up

Your UAT environment includes:

- âœ… **Complete directory structure** (`uat_environment/`)
- âœ… **Persona configurations** for all three target users
- âœ… **Test scenarios** with realistic test cases
- âœ… **Sample test data** with metadata
- âœ… **Automated test runner** for comprehensive testing
- âœ… **Monitoring and logging** capabilities
- âœ… **Report generation** and results tracking

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Setup
```bash
# Check that everything is in place
ls uat_environment/
```

You should see:
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `test_data/` - Test scenarios and metadata
- `logs/` - Logging directory
- `results/` - Results storage
- `start_uat.py` - Quick start script

### Step 2: Start UAT Testing
```bash
# Run the complete UAT process
python uat_environment/start_uat.py
```

This will:
- âœ… Validate system health
- âœ… Execute tests for all personas
- âœ… Generate comprehensive reports
- âœ… Provide pass/fail recommendations

### Step 3: Review Results
After execution, check:
- `uat_environment/results/` - Detailed results for each persona
- `uat_environment/logs/` - Execution logs
- Console output - Summary and recommendations

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "UAT environment not found"
**Solution**: Run `python uat_setup.py` first

**Issue**: "Configuration file missing"
**Solution**: Check that `uat_environment/config/uat_config.json` exists

**Issue**: "Test execution fails"
**Solution**: Verify system health with `python main.py --mode=test --action=health`

**Issue**: "Low test scores"
**Solution**: Review test scenarios and adjust success criteria if appropriate

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: Review `uat_environment/logs/` for detailed error information
2. **Validate System**: Run health checks before UAT
3. **Review Configuration**: Ensure all config files are properly formatted
4. **Contact Support**: Use the support documentation in the main UAT framework

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-UAT Checklist

Before starting UAT, ensure:

- [ ] System is running and accessible
- [ ] All dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Test environment is isolated from production
- [ ] UAT team is assembled and trained
- [ ] Test data is available (sample data provided)
- [ ] Monitoring is enabled
- [ ] Backup procedures are in place
