# Work Order #60 Implementation Summary
## Video File Upload Processing API Endpoint

**Work Order:** #60  
**Title:** Implement Video File Upload Processing API Endpoint  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** January 2025  

### Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive video file upload processing system that handles video file processing, S3 storage, database record creation, and integration with the Core Detection Engine to provide seamless upload-to-analysis workflow.

### Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **POST /v1/dashboard/upload/{session_id} endpoint** - Validates upload sessions and returns 404 for expired/invalid sessions  
✅ **File validation** - Checks video format, size constraints, and content validity before processing  
✅ **S3 upload** - Uses dashboard-uploads/{user_id} key prefix and handles upload failures with automatic cleanup  
✅ **Video database record** - Includes filename, file hash, file size, format, S3 key, and user ID  
✅ **Detection workflow integration** - Automatically initiates analysis using Core Detection Engine API after successful upload  
✅ **User upload quota** - Decremented by 1 after successful upload completion  
✅ **Comprehensive response** - Includes video ID, analysis ID, upload status, redirect URL, and estimated processing time  
✅ **Failed upload cleanup** - Triggers cleanup of S3 files and Redis sessions with appropriate error responses
