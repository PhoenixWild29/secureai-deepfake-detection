<# 🛡️ SecureAI Guardian v4.2.0-STABLE

**The Decentralized Forensic Grid for Media Authenticity.**

SecureAI Guardian is a flagship cybersecurity platform designed to defend the integrity of digital media in an era of hyper-realistic generative AI. By combining SOTA (State-of-the-Art) neural inference with blockchain-backed audit trails, it provides investigators and security professionals with a "Truth Protocol" for digital assets.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy: Frictionless Security

Traditional cybersecurity tools often create hurdles (complex logins, wallet connections, gas fees). SecureAI Guardian removes these barriers through two innovative architectural choices:

### 1. Neural Passport (Identity 2.0)
Instead of passwords, the system uses **Cryptographic Device Bonding**. 
*   **Initialization:** Upon first entry, the system provisions a unique **Forensic UID**.
*   **Bonding:** This identity is cryptographically bonded to your local environment.
*   **Seamless Access:** You don't "log in"; your device is your key. Returning to the app instantly restores your clearance level and forensic ledger.

### 2. Managed Solana Relay
Blockchain verification is critical for immutability, but wallet management is a friction point.
*   **Shadow-Signers:** Every account is mapped to a system-managed shadow-signer on the Solana network.
*   **Zero-Gas UX:** The app handles all transaction signatures and fees (covered by the platform relay), providing a "Certified Block" signature for every scan without requiring a browser extension.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🔬 The Forensic Laboratory
A multi-modal analysis suite that goes beyond simple "Real or Fake" binaries:
*   **Ensemble Inference:** Uses a combination of CLIP zero-shot scanning and LAA-Net (Layer-wise Artifact Analysis) to detect sub-perceptual patterns.
*   **Interactive Heat Probes:** Visualize neural artifacts through a 64-sector spatial entropy map. Probe specific regions to understand why the AI flagged them.
*   **Forensic Metrics:** Track Spatial Artifacts, Temporal Consistency, Spectral Density, and Vocal Frequency Jitter.

### 🧠 SecureSage: The AI Consultant
Integrated directly into the grid, SecureSage is a Gemini-powered intelligence layer:
*   **Full Context Awareness:** Sage has access to your current scan results, your node's audit history, and the technical system manual.
*   **Technical Explanations:** Ask Sage to "Decrypt the Spectral Density report" or "Explain the recent security audit failure."
*   **Protocol Guidance:** Sage assists in navigating the forensic process and explains the underlying blockchain logic.

### 📊 Security Hub & Audit Trail
*   **Global Ledger:** Every scan is recorded on a persistent ledger, providing a verifiable history of your forensic activity.
*   **System Integrity Audits:** Run the "Audit Protocol" to verify environment readiness, state integrity, and encryption stability.
*   **Exportable Affidavits:** Export scan results as JSON-based digital affidavits containing the blockchain proof and forensic metrics.

## 🏷️ Clearance Tiers (Subscription)

Clearance is framed as **Node Calibration**, allowing users to expand their capabilities contextually:

- **SENTINEL (Guest):** Standard forensic access, limited ledger history, local-only signatures.
- **PRO GUARDIAN:** Unlimited ensemble scans, LAA-Net artifact mapping, and 5 monthly Blockchain Proof-of-Trust seals.
- **NEXUS:** Enterprise-grade node with multi-signature consensus and white-glove support.
- **POWER_USER (Architect):** Root-level access. Used for system-wide overrides and global topology monitoring.
