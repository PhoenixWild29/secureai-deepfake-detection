# How to Upload and Analyze Your First Video

**Category:** Getting Started > Video Analysis
**Last Updated:** January 27, 2025
**Estimated Reading Time:** 3 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner

## Overview
This guide walks you through uploading and analyzing your first video for 
deepfake detection using SecureAI.

## Prerequisites
- Active SecureAI account
- Video file in supported format (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM)
- File size under 500MB

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Upload Interface
1. Log in to your SecureAI dashboard
2. Click the **"Analyze Video"** button in the main navigation
3. The upload interface will appear

### Step 2: Upload Your Video
You have three options:

**Option A: Drag and Drop**
- Drag your video file from your computer
- Drop it into the upload area

**Option B: File Browser**
- Click "Browse Files"
- Select your video file
- Click "Open"

**Option C: URL Upload**
- Click "Upload from URL"
- Paste the video URL
- Click "Upload"

### Step 3: Configure Analysis Options
Choose your analysis type:
- **Quick** (< 1 minute): Fast screening
- **Comprehensive** (2-5 minutes): Detailed analysis (recommended)
- **Security-focused** (3-7 minutes): Maximum scrutiny

Optional settings:
- ☑️ Detailed forensic analysis
- ☑️ Audio deepfake detection
- ☑️ Metadata examination
- ☑️ Generate blockchain proof

### Step 4: Start Analysis
Click the **"Start Analysis"** button

### Step 5: Monitor Progress
Watch the progress bar and status updates:
- Video preprocessing
- Face detection
- Facial landmark analysis
- Temporal consistency check
- Audio analysis
- Metadata examination

### Step 6: Review Results
When complete, you'll see:
- Overall verdict (Deepfake / Real)
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Detection breakdown by technique
- Recommended actions

## What the Results Mean

| Confidence | Risk Level | Meaning |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 90-100% | Critical | Definite deepfake - investigate immediately |
| 80-89% | High | Probable deepfake - manual review recommended |
| 60-79% | Medium | Suspicious - additional analysis suggested |
| 40-59% | Low | Uncertain - monitor |
| 0-39% | Very Low | Likely authentic |

## Next Steps
- Download detailed report (PDF)
- Create incident (if high risk)
- Share results with team
- Configure alerts for future analyses

## Common Issues

**Upload fails:**
- Check file size (<500MB)
- Verify format (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM)
- Check internet connection

**Slow analysis:**
- Large files take longer
- Use "Quick" analysis for faster results
- Check system status page
