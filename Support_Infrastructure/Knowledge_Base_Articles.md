### **Article 002: Understanding Confidence Scores**

**Category:** Core Features > Video Analysis  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Reading Time:** 5 minutes

#### **What Are Confidence Scores?**

Confidence scores indicate how certain the AI system is that a video is a deepfake, expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%.

#### **Score Interpretation**

| Score Range | Risk Level | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|-------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **90-100%** | 🔴 Critical | AI is very confident this is a deepfake | Immediate investigation, create security incident |
| **80-89%** | 🟠 High | Strong indicators of manipulation | Manual expert review, document findings |
| **60-79%** | 🟡 Medium | Moderate suspicion, some red flags | Additional analysis, monitor closely |
| **40-59%** | 🟢 Low | Uncertain, borderline case | Request second opinion, use security-focused analysis |
| **0-39%** | ⚪ Very Low | Likely authentic video | Standard documentation, no special action |

#### **Factors Affecting Confidence**

**Increases Confidence:**
- Multiple detection techniques agree
- Clear manipulation indicators
- High-quality source video
- Complete metadata available

**Decreases Confidence:**
- Poor video quality
- Heavy compression
- Short video duration
- Missing metadata

#### **Best Practices**

✅ **DO:**
- Use confidence scores as one factor in decision-making
- Consider the context and source
- Review detailed analysis for high-stakes decisions
- Combine with human expertise for critical cases

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rely solely on confidence scores
- Ignore low scores if context is suspicious
- Make irreversible decisions without review
- Skip detailed analysis for important videos

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Articles

### **Article 101: Troubleshooting Upload Failures**

**Category:** Troubleshooting  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Reading Time:** 4 minutes

#### **Common Upload Issues**

**Error: "File too large"**
```
Problem: Video exceeds 500MB limit
Solutions:
1. Compress video using these settings:
   - Codec: H.264
   - Bitrate: 5 Mbps
   - Resolution: 1080p max
   - Tool: HandBrake, FFmpeg

2. Split video into smaller segments
   
3. Upgrade to Enterprise tier (unlimited size)

Command to compress with FFmpeg:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec h264 -b:v 5M output.mp4
```

**Error: "Unsupported format"**
```
Problem: Video format not supported
Supported: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM
Unsupported: FLV, WMV, 3GP

Solution: Convert to MP4 using:
ffmpeg -i input.flv -c:v h264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

**Error: "Upload timeout"**
```
Problem: Network connection interrupted
Solutions:
1. Check internet connection speed (need 10+ Mbps)
2. Try uploading during off-peak hours
3. Use API upload for better reliability
4. Contact support for large file assistance
```

**Error: "Invalid video file"**
```
Problem: File is corrupted or not a valid video
Solutions:
1. Verify file plays in video player
2. Re-export from source
3. Try different encoding
4. Contact support if file is valid
```

#### **Prevention Tips**
- Keep videos under 400MB for best results
- Use MP4 format with H.264 codec
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Test with small file first

### **Article 102: API Authentication Errors**

**Category:** Troubleshooting > API  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Reading Time:** 6 minutes

#### **Common API Errors**

**Error 401: Unauthorized**
```
Cause: Invalid or expired API token
Solutions:

1. Verify token is not expired
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours (default)
   - Generate new token in dashboard
   
2. Check header format:
   Correct: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   Wrong: Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
   Wrong: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

3. Ensure token has required permissions
   - Check token permissions in dashboard
   - Regenerate with correct permissions

4. Verify you're using the correct API endpoint
   - Production: https://api.secureai.com/v1
   - Staging: https://staging-api.secureai.com/v1

Example (Python):
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
```

**Error 429: Rate Limited**
```
Cause: Too many requests in short time
Solutions:

1. Check your rate limits:
   - Starter: 10 requests/minute
   - Professional: 50 requests/minute
   - Enterprise: 100 requests/minute

2. Implement exponential backoff:
   
import time

def api_request_with_retry(url, headers, data, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        
        if response.status_code != 429:
            return response
        
        wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # 1s, 2s, 4s
        time.sleep(wait_time)
    
    return response

3. Use batch endpoints for multiple videos
4. Upgrade tier for higher limits
```

**Error 500: Internal Server Error**
```
Cause: Server-side issue
Solutions:

1. Check system status: https://status.secureai.com
2. Retry request after brief delay
3. If persistent:
   - Save request details
   - Note timestamp and error
   - Contact support with request ID
   
4. Temporary workaround: Use web interface
```
