## 🎯 Escalation Overview

### **When to Escalate**

**Escalate Immediately:**
- ✅ System-wide outage or critical failure
- ✅ Security breach or data leak
- ✅ Data loss or corruption
- ✅ Multiple enterprise customers affected
- ✅ P1 issue exceeds initial response SLA

**Escalate After Troubleshooting:**
- ✅ Issue requires specialized technical expertise
- ✅ Requires code changes or bug fixes
- ✅ Integration problems beyond configuration
- ✅ After 30 minutes without progress (Tier 1)
- ✅ After 2 hours without progress (Tier 2)

**Do Not Escalate:**
- ❌ Customer impatience (manage expectations instead)
- ❌ Before completing basic troubleshooting
- ❌ For issues within your tier's capability
- ❌ As a way to offload work

### **Escalation Scenarios (Practice)**

**Scenario 1: API Authentication Issues**
```
Customer: "Our API integration stopped working this morning. All requests 
          are getting 401 errors."

Analysis:
  - Priority: P2 (High) - blocking customer operations
  - Tier 1 can: Check token validity, verify header format
  - Tier 2 needed if: Token is valid but still failing
  - Tier 3 needed if: Authentication service issue

Decision: Start with Tier 1, escalate to Tier 2 if basic checks pass

Escalation Trigger: After verifying token is valid and format is correct
```

**Scenario 2: System Performance**
```
Customer: "The analysis is taking 10+ minutes instead of the usual 2 minutes."

Analysis:
  - Priority: P3 (Medium) - degraded performance
  - Tier 1 can: Check system status, verify video size
  - Tier 2 needed if: System-wide performance issue
  - Tier 3 needed if: Requires infrastructure changes

Decision: Check status page and customer's video characteristics first

Escalation Trigger: If multiple customers reporting same issue
```

**Scenario 3: Data Privacy Concern**
```
Customer: "We need to ensure our GDPR compliance. Can you delete all data 
          for user ID 12345?"

Analysis:
  - Priority: P2 (High) - compliance/legal
  - Tier 1 can: Provide GDPR request form
  - Tier 2 needed if: Technical implementation questions
  - Compliance team: For verification and approval

Decision: Immediate escalation to Compliance team + Tier 2

Escalation Trigger: Any GDPR/legal request requires compliance review
