Comprehensive List of GitHub Repositories for Building a Deepfake Detection Tool
Based on a thorough search of GitHub, including topic pages and curated "awesome" lists, below is a compiled list of relevant repositories that could help you build an advanced deepfake detection tool. These include datasets (essential for training and benchmarking), benchmarks/frameworks (for evaluation and standardization), detection models/tools (implementations of algorithms), and resource collections (curated lists of papers and code). I've focused on unique, high-quality repos related to deepfake detection, drawing from multiple sources to aim for comprehensiveness. Repos are grouped by category for clarity, with brief descriptions, star counts (where available from search results), and why they might help your tool (e.g., for AI models, blockchain integration with Solana, or video focus).
This list is not exhaustive (GitHub has thousands of related repos), but it prioritizes popular, actively maintained, or academically cited ones as of September 2025. For the "best" tool, start with benchmarks like DeepfakeBench for standardization, datasets like DF40 for modern forgeries, and models like those in awesome lists for SOTA implementations. You can fork and combine them (e.g., use PyTorch-based detectors with your Solana off-chain processing).
