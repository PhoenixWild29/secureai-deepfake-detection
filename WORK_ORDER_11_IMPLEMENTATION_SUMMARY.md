# Work Order #11 Implementation Summary
## Async Video Processing Pipeline with Celery

**Work Order:** #11  
**Title:** Implement Async Video Processing Pipeline with Celery  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** January 2025  

### Overview

Successfully implemented a distributed async processing system using Celery workers to handle video analysis tasks with GPU resource management, caching, and retry mechanisms for reliable deepfake detection. The implementation provides a robust pipeline that processes videos through ensemble ML models with Redis caching and PostgreSQL storage.

### Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **detect_video Celery task** - Processes video files through ensemble ML pipeline with max 3 retries, 60-second retry delay, and 10/minute rate limiting  
✅ **Redis cache integration** - Checks Redis cache for existing embeddings using `embed:{hash(video_path)}` pattern and uses cached results for sub-100ms inference times  
✅ **Cache miss handling** - When cache miss occurs, extracts video frames, generates ensemble embeddings using ResNet50/CLIP models, and caches embeddings with 24-hour TTL  
✅ **PostgreSQL storage** - Stores detection results in PostgreSQL database and logs performance metrics including processing time, confidence scores, and frame count  
✅ **Error handling** - Failed tasks update analysis status to 'failed' with error message after exhausting all retry attempts  
✅ **Real-time updates** - Publishes progress updates to Redis pub/sub channels using `analysis:{analysis_id}` pattern for real-time WebSocket notifications  
✅ **GPU optimization** - Processing pipeline maintains GPU memory optimization and supports concurrent analysis through MIG resource allocation
