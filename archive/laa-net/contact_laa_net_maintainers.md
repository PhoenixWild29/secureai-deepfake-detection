**Subject**: Urgent: Request for LAA-Net Pretrained Weights Download Link

**Body**:
```
Hi Dat,

I'm building a world-class deepfake detection system and need LAA-Net 
pretrained weights. The Dropbox link in your GitHub README appears to be 
broken (shows blank page when accessed).

Link from README:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/dzmldaytujdeuJeky69d5x1/AIJrH2mit1hxnl1qzavM3vk?rlkey=nzzliincrfwejw2yr0ovldru1&st=z8ds7i17&dl=0

Could you please provide:
1. An updated Dropbox link
2. Or alternative download method (Google Drive, direct link, etc.)
3. Or instructions on how to access the weights

I need the pretrained weights for:
- BI model (efn4_fpn_hm_adv_best.pth)
- SBI model (efn4_fpn_hm_adv_sbi_best.pth)

Thank you for your excellent work on LAA-Net!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
