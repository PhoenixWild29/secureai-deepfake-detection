### **Sample Scenario Questions**

**Scenario 1:**
```
A customer reports that video uploads are failing with "File too large" errors. 
The customer says the video is 450MB and in MP4 format.

What is the correct response?

A) Tell them the system doesn't support files that large
B) Explain the 500MB limit and suggest compressing the video ✓
C) Escalate to engineering immediately
D) Tell them to split the video into parts

Explanation: The 500MB limit is higher than the customer's file size (450MB), 
so the issue is likely something else. However, compression might help. 
The best response is B, but you should also investigate why a 450MB file 
is failing when the limit is 500MB.
```

**Scenario 2:**
```
You notice the analysis queue has grown to 500 pending videos and processing 
is slow. What should you do first?

A) Restart all services
B) Check system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) ✓
C) Increase the queue size limit
D) Disable new video uploads

Explanation: Before making changes, you need to diagnose the root cause. 
Checking resource usage helps identify if the issue is CPU, memory, disk I/O, 
or network-related.
