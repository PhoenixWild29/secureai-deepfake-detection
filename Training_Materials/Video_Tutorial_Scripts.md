"Confidence: 95.7%
Risk Level: HIGH

A confidence score of 95.7% means the system is highly certain this is a deepfake. Scores above 90% warrant immediate investigation.

Now let's break down the detection results:"

[Scroll to detection breakdown]

"• Facial Analysis: 97.2% - Detected inconsistent facial landmarks
• Temporal Consistency: 89.5% - Found frame-to-frame anomalies
• Audio Analysis: 94.3% - Identified synthetic voice characteristics
• Metadata: 92.1% - Detected signs of video editing

Each technique provides independent evidence. When multiple techniques agree, confidence increases."

[Show key indicators section]

"The system also identifies specific indicators:
• Face swap technique detected
• 23 facial landmark inconsistencies
• Voice cloning detected
• Video metadata shows editing software signatures

This forensic detail helps you understand exactly what was manipulated."

[Show recommended actions]

"Based on these results, the system recommends:
1. Create security incident immediately
2. Quarantine this video
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Preserve evidence for investigation

Let's see how to take these actions."
```

**[TAKING ACTION - 9:00-9:45]**
