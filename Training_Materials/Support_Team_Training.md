## 🔧 Common Support Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Account Access Issues**

#### **Issue: Customer Cannot Log In**

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. "What error message are you seeing?"
2. "Have you recently changed your password?"
3. "Are you using the correct username/email?"
4. "Is two-factor authentication enabled on your account?"

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
```
Step 1: Verify Account Status
- Check if account is active in admin panel
- Verify email address is correct
- Check for any account locks or suspensions

Step 2: Password Reset
- Guide customer through password reset:
  1. Click "Forgot Password" on login page
  2. Enter email address
  3. Check email for reset link
  4. Create new password
  5. Log in with new credentials

Step 3: Two-Factor Authentication Issues
- If 2FA is enabled but not working:
  1. Verify time synchronization on device
  2. Use backup codes if available
  3. Contact admin to reset 2FA (if necessary)

Step 4: Account Unlock (if locked)
- Check admin panel for account status
- Unlock account if locked due to failed attempts
- Advise customer to wait 15 minutes if recently locked
```

**Resolution Template:**
```
"I've [action taken]. You should now be able to log in using:
- Username: [username]
- New password: [temporary password]
- Please change your password upon first login.

If you continue to experience issues, please call our support line at [phone number]."
```

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Account appears compromised
- System-wide authentication issues
- Repeated failures after troubleshooting

### **Scenario 2: Video Upload Failures**

#### **Issue: Customer Cannot Upload Video**

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. "What is the file size of the video?"

3. "What error message are you seeing?"
4. "Are you uploading from the web interface or API?"

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
```
Step 1: Verify File Requirements
- Check file size: Maximum 500MB
- Check format: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WEBM
- Check video integrity: Not corrupted

Step 2: Common Issues and Fixes

Issue: "File too large"
Fix: 
- Compress video using recommended settings
- Or split video into smaller segments
- Or upgrade to higher tier for larger limits

Issue: "Unsupported format"
Fix:
- Convert video to MP4 format
- Recommended: H.264 codec, AAC audio
- Use ffmpeg or similar tool

Issue: "Network timeout"
Fix:

- Consistent failures for specific customer
- Infrastructure or storage issues

### **Scenario 3: Interpretation of Results**

#### **Issue: Customer Doesn't Understand Results**

**Educational Response:**
```
"Let me explain your analysis results:

Your video received a confidence score of [X]%, which means:
- 90-100%: Very high certainty of deepfake
- 80-89%: High probability of deepfake  
- 60-79%: Moderate suspicion
- Below 60%: Likely authentic

In your case, with [X]% confidence, we recommend:
[Specific recommendation based on score]

The system detected these indicators:
1. [Indicator 1] - [Explanation]
2. [Indicator 2] - [Explanation]
3. [Indicator 3] - [Explanation]

Would you like me to walk you through the detailed forensic report?"
```

- Detection techniques used
- Recommended actions based on results
- How to access detailed reports
- When to escalate for human review

**Escalation Criteria:**

- False positive/negative concerns
- Need for expert analysis

### **Scenario 4: API Integration Issues**

#### **Issue: Customer Has API Problems**

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. "What programming language are you using?"
2. "What error code/message are you receiving?"
3. "Can you share the API request you're making?"
4. "Have you verified your API token is valid?"

**Common API Issues:**

**Issue: 401 Unauthorized**
```
Diagnosis: Authentication failure
Fix:
1. Verify API token is valid and not expired
2. Check token is included in Authorization header
3. Format: "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
4. Regenerate token if necessary
```

**Issue: 429 Rate Limited**
```
Diagnosis: Too many requests
Fix:
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Reduce request frequency
3. Use batch endpoints for multiple videos
4. Upgrade tier for higher limits
```

**Issue: 500 Internal Server Error**
```
Diagnosis: Server-side issue
Fix:
1. Check system status page
2. Retry request after delay
3. If persistent, escalate to Tier 3
4. Provide request ID for investigation
```

**Sample Code Examples to Share:**

```python
# Correct API usage example
import requests
import time

def analyze_video_with_retry(video_path, max_retries=3):
    """Analyze video with automatic retry logic"""
    
    api_url = "https://api.secureai.com/v1/analyze/video"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with open(video_path, 'rb') as video_file:
                files = {'video': video_file}
                response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, files=files)
                
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    return response.json()
                elif response.status_code == 429:
                    # Rate limited, wait and retry
                    wait_time = 2 ** attempt
                    time.sleep(wait_time)
                    continue
                else:
                    return {"error": f"Request failed: {response.status_code}"}
        
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {str(e)}")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
    
    return {"error": "Max retries exceeded"}
```

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Persistent API failures
- Rate limiting issues despite optimization
