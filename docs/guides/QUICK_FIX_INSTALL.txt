========================================
QUICK FIX FOR INSTALLATION ISSUES
========================================

Based on your terminal output, here's what happened:

✅ ALREADY INSTALLED:
- albumentations-1.1.0
- imgaug-0.4.0  
- scikit-image-0.25.2 (newer version - this is fine!)
- numpy and other dependencies

❌ STILL NEEDED:
1. open-clip-torch (critical for CLIP detection)
2. mtcnn (for face detection)

========================================
QUICK FIX - Run These Commands:
========================================

1. Upgrade pip first:
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip

2. Install open-clip-torch:
   python -m pip install open-clip-torch>=2.20.0

   If that fails, try:
   python -m pip install open-clip-torch --no-cache-dir

3. Install face detection:
   python -m pip install mtcnn>=0.1.1

========================================
OR USE THE FIXED SCRIPT:
========================================

Run: install_ensemble_dependencies_fixed.bat

This script:
- Upgrades pip first
- Handles errors better
- Uses flexible versions

========================================
VERIFY IT WORKS:
========================================

python -c "import open_clip; print('✓ open-clip-torch OK')"
python test_ensemble_detector.py

========================================
NOTES:
========================================

- scikit-image 0.25.2 is actually BETTER than 0.17.2
- Most dependencies are already installed
- Only open-clip-torch is critical for CLIP detection
- Once open-clip-torch installs, the detector will work!
